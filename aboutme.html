It was cool being able to think throughhow to create a user-friendly website that keeps people coming back to it.

I've never programmed a circut, and I think it was a little more difficult because you had to not only logically think about the code, but also relate it to the physical circut. However, once we got the first one to work, it became easier figuring out what to do because the general idea is the same. My group worked well together,we split up our group of four in half, two of us figured out the code and the other two worked on setting up the circut. ";
