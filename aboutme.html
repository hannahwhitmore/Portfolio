<h1>Day 6 Reflection</h1>
<p>One of the similarities between python and scratch are the way shapes are drawn.
  In both the formula 360-# of sides is important because it determines the degree of rotation. 
  One of the main difference is the interface because in Scratch there are a lot of graphics whereas with python it is simply syntax. </p>
 
  <p1>I overall enjoyed making today's game, especially because of how user-interactive it is so that they are always interested. 
  The only different part was keeping track of all of the if statements and different options. Learning about functions was also
  interesting because it's easy to see how useful they would be with a project with a lot of lines of code.</p1>
  
  A list combines data and stores it together. A list can be used with a random number generator to pick out one piece of data or 
  conditionals could be used to pick out data that meets certain requirements. Lists are useful especially when thinking of real world 
  applications like filters. <p>
