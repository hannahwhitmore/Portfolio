<h1> Reflection 1 </h1>
<p>One of the similarities between python and scratch are the way shapes are drawn.
  In both the formula 360-# of sides is important because it determines the degree of rotation. 
  One of the main difference is the interface because in Scratch there are a lot of graphics whereas with python it is simply syntax. </p>
 
<h2> Reflection 2 </h2>
  <p2>I overall enjoyed making today's game, especially because of how user-interactive it is so that they are always interested. 
  The only different part was keeping track of all of the if statements and different options. Learning about functions was also
  interesting because it's easy to see how useful they would be with a project with a lot of lines of code.</p2>
  
<h3> Reflection 2 </h3>  
 <p3> A list combines data and stores it together. A list can be used with a random number generator to pick out one piece of data or 
  conditionals could be used to pick out data that meets certain requirements. Lists are useful especially when thinking of real world 
  applications like filters. </p3>

    I thought going to Refinery 29 was great. I liked how they promoted a positive self-image especially for women. I also liked how we were able to 
    think creativly when they aksed for our input on their website and allowed us to add our own ideas. It was cool being able to think through
    how to create a user-friendly website that keeps people coming back to it. The only thing I would have liked to see more of the
    building itself and the different departments.

    I liked the games we coded today. For the roulette, there was a lot to keep track of but having an overall idea of what to do and 
    an outline made it a lot easier. I worked well with my partner, and running the finished program at the end was really cool since
    there were a lot of different elements to it. I worked well with my partner, Ruhika and we got the game done pretty fast.
